# Social Media Analytics for Twitter

## Project Overview
This project uses machine learning to analyze Twitter data and identify the key predictors of social influence. The project explores the relationships between various Twitter metrics, such as follower count, listed count, retweets received, and mentions sent, to determine which factors contribute most to a user's social influence.

## Dataset
The project uses a dataset containing 11 variables describing each person's Twitter activity. The dataset is not included in this repository, but it can be obtained by contacting the author.

## Methodology
The project employs several machine learning models, including:

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- XGBoost

to analyze the dataset and identify the key predictors of social influence. The models are evaluated using metrics such as:

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score

## Key Findings
The project finds that the key predictors of social influence on Twitter are:

- A/B_listed_count
- A/B_follower_count
- A/B_network_feature_3
- A/B_retweets_received
- A/B_network_feature_2

These findings suggest that users with a high listed count, follower count, and network feature scores, as well as those who receive a high number of retweets, are more likely to have a strong social influence on Twitter.

## Code
The project code is written in Python and uses popular libraries such as:

- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost

The code is organized into several sections, including:

1. Data loading
2. Data exploration
3. Machine learning
4. Model evaluation

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
